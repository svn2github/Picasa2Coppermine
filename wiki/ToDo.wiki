= Introduction =

These are some things that I have in mind to implement/include in Picasa2Coppermine

= Details =

Installation

  * ~~[ToDoPlugin Use the Coppermine Plugin API] to make it easier to install~~
  * ~~Automate the creation of the .pbz file~~
  * Get the Coppermine logo to appear properly in the Picasa button

Usage

  * ~~Add the ability to import the file data (caption, keywords) from Picasa into Coppermine~~ (n/a since this could be done via separate IPTC import tool)
  * Upload video files
