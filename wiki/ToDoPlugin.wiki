= Introduction =

Here are some thoughts on what the plugin version of picasa2coppermine might entail to be useful.

= Plugin =

  *  ~~Installation process of plugin~~
       * ~~Get url of gallery via config to help generate the .pbf file~~
       * ~~Use an archive library to put the .pbf and .psd file into an archive~~
          * Need to check if the site supports such a library and provide instructions if the admin must do this manually
       * ~~Rename the file to .pbz~~
    * ~~After the .pbz file is created, provide a link to it to the admin~~
  * ~~If index.html could be a .php file instead, it could get gallery url via config. ~~
    * ~~Maybe use of the plugin would allow access to include/ whereas being in the `picasa` subfolder currently does not~~

= Settings =

  * Allow non-admin user to use Picasa button to do the uploads
    * Let's see if there is demand
    * Also need to make sure that this will be secure
